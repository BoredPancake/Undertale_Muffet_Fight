# Undertale_Muffet_Fight
 Unity remake of the Muffet boss fight from Undertale. Undertale belongs to Toby Fox.

I got most assets from here https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/undertale/

I'm just a beginner. As you can clearly see in the code, I have no idea what I'm doing at all.
There are some bugs (e.g. spamming z when sparing makes the dialogue box bigger during enemy turn)
and some things that I couldn't recreate, but I tried to make it as accurate to the original as I could.

I think that's all I wanted to say.
